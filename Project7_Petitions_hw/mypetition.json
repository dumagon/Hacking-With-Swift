After two years, and no findings of collusion or obstruction, the investigation has been derailed into an ongoing, non-ending witch hunt, obliterating,  intimidating, and bankrupting staffers and family, setting traps in the pursuit of revenge for having had won an election fairly and against all odds. A blind eye has been applied to the real corrupt agents of the federal government allowing them to retire with pensions and untouched by justice. We demand this persecution be stopped and he is allowed to govern for the benefit of our national security without further distractions. We demand that the real corrupt colluders and obstructers are brought to justice and that their benefits be removed. We support our president.",
